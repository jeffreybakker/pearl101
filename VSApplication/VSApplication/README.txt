By checking the speed of the first program that started we compare it to newer programs. If at a certain moment a big difference
is noticable, the amount of programs-1 is the amount of cores your PC has.
You can not know it if you have less programs running than you have cores.

For linux, if you use only 4 threads, it runs stable for all 4 threads, but if you add another thread, the hyperthreading
activates. And all of the programs get a boost so now and then, but it is visible that the speed decreases.

b) 
It does not matter if the window has focus on Windows.
For linux it also doesn't matter if the window has focus (in PyCharm)
